## Contributing

I accept Pull Requests via GitHub. There are some guidelines which will make applying PRs easier for me:

- No tabs! Please use spaces for indentation.
- Respect the existing code style for each file.
- Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports. If you feel the source code should be reformatted create a separate PR for this change.
- Provide JUnit tests for your changes and make sure your changes don't break any existing tests by running gradle.
